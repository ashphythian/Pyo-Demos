# Pyo Musical Demos

[Pyo](http://ajaxsoundstudio.com/pyo/) is a Digital Signal Processor module for
Python.

It is an extremely deep and versatile DSP, and I wish to slowly build up a
collection of tools and submodules to expand upon it.

The current collection can simply be loaded and played by the GUI.

## TODOs
* Add more demo "songs"
* Add functions for:
  * Add a BPM function
  * Simplified percussion creation/playing
  * Fixing a piece to a key
  * Playing chords with more natural language
* Add more TODOs
